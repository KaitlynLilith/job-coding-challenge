Coding: Vending Machine

The goal of this tech challenge is to build a simple vending machine simulation. This can be done on web or mobile.

Milestone 1
Starting off simple -- very simple. Milestone 1 is to have the vending machine accept and add change.

Show a blank input form with an "Insert Money" button.
User can enter the following values: "5", "10" or "25", i.e. nickel, dime or quarter.
When the "Insert Money" button is clicked, display the total amount of money inserted.
Milestone 2
Now that we've inserted money, we'd like to actually pick a drink!

Add three boxes above the money input form.
One box should feature an image of Coke, with a displayed price of 25 cents; one should feature an image of Pepsi, with a displayed price of 35 cents; and one should feature Orange Crush, with a displayed price of 45 cents.
Under each box should be a button that says "Choose Item".
When the user clicks "Choose Item", display a message letting them know which selection they made.
Milestone 3
Now that we've picked our drink of choice, let's see if we can actually afford it.

After the user clicks "Choose Item", make an alert asking them to confirm their choice.
If the user confirms the choice and has enough money, add styling around their choice to confirm it has been successfully vended.
If the user confirms the choice and did not have enough money, display a message telling them they did not have enough money.
If the user does not confirm the choice, display the original screen with the three options and their total money.
Milestone 4
Time to give our user their change or a refund, depending on their choice.

If the user confirms the choice and has enough money, also show how much change they will receive.
If the user confirms the choice and did not have enough money, display how much more money they need to insert.
Add a "Refund" button; when clicked, have the user confirm they would like a refund, and then display a message telling them how much money has been refunded. This should set their total back to zero.
Congrats! That's all, folks!
